The total initial ionic strength of the aqueous phase was found to play a critical function in determining particle size. A formula has been derived from the experimental data which enables the preparative conditions required to form a latex, containing particles of a particular size, to be predicted.",

  abstract={Colloids coated with lipid membranes have been widely employed for fundamental studies of lipid membrane processes, biotechnological applications such as drug delivery and biosensing, and more recently, for self-assembly. The latter has been made possible by inserting DNA oligomers with covalently linked hydrophobic anchors into the membrane. The lateral mobility of the DNA linkers on micrometer-sized droplets and solid particles has opened the door to creating structures with unprecedented structural flexibility. Here, we investigate micro-emulsions of TPM (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate) as a platform for lipid monolayers and further functionalization with proteins and DNA oligonucleotides. TPM droplets can be produced with a narrow size distribution and are polymerizable, thus providing supports for model lipid membranes with controlled size and curvature. With fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we observed that droplet-attached lipids, NeutrAvidin proteins, as well as DNA oligonucleotides all show mobility on the surface. We explored the assembly of micron-sized particles on TPM-droplets by exploiting either avidin–biotin interactions or double-stranded DNA with complementary single-stranded end groups. While the single molecules are mobile, the particles that are attached to them are not. We propose that this is caused by the heterogeneous nature of emulsified TPM, which forms an oligomer network that limits the collective motion of linkers, but allows the surface mobility of individual molecules.}

We then use a tempered Markov-chain Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior probability distributions of the model parameters: particle position, size, and refractive index. Compared to least-squares fitting, our approach allows us to more easily incorporate prior information about the parameters and to obtain more accurate uncertainties, which are critical for both particle tracking and characterization experiments. Our approach also eliminates the need to supply accurate initial guesses for the parameters, so it requires little tuning.},

Extracting this wealth of information begins by detecting and localizing features of interest within individual holograms. Conventionally approached with heuristic algorithms, this image analysis problem can be solved faster and more generally with machine-learning techniques. We demonstrate that two popular machine-learning algorithms, cascade classifiers and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), can solve the feature-localization problem orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art techniques. Our CNN implementation localizes holographic features precisely enough to bootstrap more detailed analyses based on the Lorenz-Mie theory of light scattering. The wavelet-based Haar cascade proves to be less precise, but is so computationally efficient that it creates new opportunities for applications that emphasize speed and low cost. We demonstrate its use as a real-time targeting system for holographic optical trapping.},

volume="24",

pages="683--694",
abstract="The Hough transform is a well-established family of algorithms for locating and describing geometric figures in an image. However, the computational complexity of the algorithm used to calculate the transform is high when used to target complex objects. As a result, the use of the Hough transform to find objects more complex than lines is uncommon in real-time applications. We describe a convolution method for calculating the Hough transform for finding circles of arbitrary radius. The algorithm operates by performing a three-dimensional convolution of the input image with an appropriate Hough kernel. The use of the fast Fourier transform to calculate the convolution results in a Hough transform algorithm with reduced computational complexity and thus increased speed. Edge detection and other convolution-based image processing operations can be incorporated as part of the transform, which removes the need to perform them with a separate pre-processing or post-processing step. As the Discrete Fourier Transform implements circular convolution rather than linear convolution, consideration must be given to padding the input image before forming the Hough transform.",

Extracting that information typically is computationally intensive, and thus slow. Here, we demonstrate that machine-learning techniques based on support vector machines (SVMs) can analyze holographic video microscopy data in real time on low-power computers. The resulting stream of precise particle-resolved tracking and characterization data provides unparalleled insights into the composition and dynamics of colloidal dispersions and enables applications ranging from basic research to process control and quality assurance.},

In particular, we focus on properties that are different from those of C-support vector classification (C-SVC) andv-support vector classification (v-SVC). We then discuss some issues that do not occur in the case of classification: the possible range of ɛ and the scaling of target values. A practical decomposition method forv-SVR is implemented, and computational experiments are conducted. We show some interesting numerical observations specific to regression. }

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new technique for high-quality reconstruction from single digital holographic acquisitions. The unknown complex object field is found as the solution of a nonlinear inverse problem that consists in the minimization of an energy functional. The latter includes total-variation (TV) regularization terms that constrain the spatial amplitude and phase distributions of the reconstructed data. The algorithm that we derive tolerates downsampling, which allows to acquire substantially fewer measurements for reconstruction compared to the state of the art. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through several experiments on simulated and real off-axis holograms.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition methods can be used in the context of digital holography to perform the task of object detection, classification, and position extraction directly from the hologram rather than from the reconstructed optical field. These approaches may exploit the differences between the holographic signatures of objects coming from distinct object classes and/or different depth positions. Direct matching of diffraction patterns, however, becomes computationally intractable with increasing variability of objects due to the very high dimensionality of the dictionary of all reference diffraction patterns. We show that most of the diffraction pattern variability can be captured in a lower dimensional space. Good performance for object recognition and localization is demonstrated at a reduced computational cost using a low-dimensional dictionary. The principle of the method is illustrated on a digit recognition problem and on a video of experimental holograms of particles.},
