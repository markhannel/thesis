\section{Pursuing Quantitative Microscopy}

Microscopy continues to evolve from a qualitative technique into a
quantitative technique; while microscopy has allowed diagramming
and annotation of sub-visible features, researchers have demonstrated
that a trove of quantitative information exists within microscopy images.

% fluorescent labeling, super-resolution microscopy, digital microscopy
% provide increased localization.
% While ray optics paired with expensive optics leads researchers to
% interpret each microscopic image as a 1-to-1 depiction of life in the
% sample, the reality is much more complicated. Diffraction, real
% optics, focus.. images are complicated.
% Reseachers who want access to the deluge of quantitative
% information able via microscopy have
