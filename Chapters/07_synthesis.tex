\chapter{Optimizing the synthesis of monodisperse colloidal spheres}
\label{ch:synthesis}

\section{Introduction}

The earliest reference to emulsion polymerization dates back to
1909 \cite{bayer1909,finch03} to a patent awarded to Felix Hoffmann and
co-workers at Farbenfabriken Bayer for their pioneering work in producing
synthetic latex.
Techniques for polymerizing emulsions have progressed through
intuitive leaps guided by fundamental principles of chemistry
and physics.  Quite often, the importance of particular chemical
or physical conditions to the outcome are gauged once
synthesis is complete, and requires multiple orthogonal measurement
techniques. Examples include measurements of the particles' size distribution,
their surface texture, and their porosity. Holographic particle
characterization can streamline this analysis by providing particle-resolved assays
of samples' size distributions and composition rapidly and with
minimal sample preparation.

%Holographic assays provide information that is useful for designing synthetic
%pathways and can help to detect and diagnose deficiencies. These measurements
%can proceed rapidly enough, moreover, to provide real-time feedback during
%synthesis. We illustrate these capacities by analyzing the synthesis of a
%particularly interest colloidal suspension.


In this chapter, we use holographic particle characterization
to explore the role of stoichiometry, initiator choice, and
agitation conditions on the synthesis of monodisperse spheres of
3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TPM) \cite{vanderwel17},
a model system with increasingly widespread applications
in soft-matter research \cite{sacanna11,liu16,vanderwel18}.
We employ holographic particle characterization
in tandem with conventional particle characterization
techniques to identify factors that influence size selection, polydispersity,
and surface texture.
This study extends the work of van der Wel \emph{et. al} \cite{vanderwel17}, which
uses conventional characterization techniques to systematically
characterize the emulsion polymerization protocol for TPM spheres.
Analysis with these orthogonal techniques serve to validate results
obtained by HPC.

\section{Synthesizing TPM spheres}

Since their introduction in 2010 \cite{}, TPM spheres have been used to
study self-assembly \cite{}, active matter \cite{}  and colloidal photonics \cite{}.
They are particularly attractive for optical studies because they can be
simultaneously density matched and index matched to their surrounding
media \cite{}.
A comparatively straightforward synthesis readily produces monodisperse spheres
with sizes selected reproducibly in the range of a few hundred nanometers to a
few micrometers \cite{liu16}.
Unlike the better-known syntheses of polystyrene \cite{goodwin1974} and
silica \cite{stober68},
emulsion polymerization of TPM requires no specialized equipment or
inert environment.

Several parameters in the synthesis influence TPM spheres' average size.
This chapter describes how holographic particle
characterization can guide the synthesis of TPM spheres by elucidating how
physical and chemical conditions affect the properties of synthesized particles.

Our procedure for synthesizing TPM spheres is described in section
\ref{ssec:synthesizing_tpm} with the
exception of initiator choice. We reiterate the synthesis protocol
here to underscore the conditions we varied and to enumerate the
\num{32} samples of droplets and polymerized spheres we analyzed.
A detailed account of the polymer chemistry underlying this
protocol is provided in Ref.~\cite{vanderwel17}.

\subsection{Emulsion polymerization}
\label{ssec:polymerization}

Controlling the size, monodispersity, and composition of colloidal spheres is crucial
for many applications including micrometer scale self-assembly \cite{pusey87,sacanna11}.
In this study we investigate the influence of stir rate, concentration of ammonium chloride,
concentration of TPM oil, and radical initiator choice on the size and refractive index
of the manufactured particles. To do so, we prepared numerous batches of TPM particles
with independent deviations from the above synthesis protocol and
characterized the resulting particles with holographic particle characterization.

The synthesis begins with the formation of an emulsion of monodisperse TPM droplets.
Monomeric TPM, ((3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate, \SI{98}{\percent}, Sigma Aldrich)
which is insoluble in water, is added to a basic environment
(pH $>$ \num{9}) of ammonium chloride (\SI{29}{\percent}) in water.
The monomers undergo hydrolysis in water and become water soluble. 
In a basic environment, these hydrolyzed monomers form insoluble 
oligomers. As the suspension is stirred, the oligomers condense 
homogeneously into monodisperse droplets that continue to grow as more oligomers form.
After \num{2} hours, the abundance of free hydrolyzed monomer is depleted
causing oligomerization to halt and therefore droplet growth to cease.
The emulsion is then heated to \SI{80}{\degreeCelsius} and a free radical 
initiator is introduced to polymerize the droplets and form solid spheres.

% Shouldn't I be using past tense here?
The dissociation of ammonium chloride in water leads to the production of ammonia
gas, which escapes the solution and lessens its pH.
To mitigate this effect, emulsion formation is completed in a closed vial.
Additionally we use identical \SI{12}{\milli\liter} vials to produce \SI{5}{\milli\liter}
of colloidal suspension in each synthesis so that the amount of enclosed air, and therefore
loss in pH, is consistent across samples. Identical stir bars are used for all syntheses
to ensure consistent flow properties.

\subsection{Holographic particle characterization}

We perform holographic characterization measurements with a Spheryx xSight,
a commercial holographic particle characterization system
that automates the methods described in the previous chapters.
The xSight flows a colloidal suspension through the observation volume of a conventional microscope
and illuminates the suspension with a laser operating at a vacuum wavelength of \SI{532}{\nm}.
The proprietary software and hardware implemented in
the instrument yield the size and refractive index for each observed colloidal spheres and
does so in a fraction of the time we typically spend analyzing an experimental video.
Because we are only interested in collecting population statistics for the size and refractive
index of our colloidal systems, we utilize the xSight rather than our custom-built microscope.

The xSight analyzes colloidal dispersions with particle number densities below 
\SI{E6}{\milli\liter^{-1}} to minimize the occurrence of overlapping holograms.
This is consistent with our discussion in section \ref{ssec:sample_prep}.
The emulsification polymerization process described in section \ref{ssec:polymerization}
produces a sample with a number density of \SI{E10}{\milli\liter^{-1}}.
We therefore dilute each of our samples by a factor of \SI{E4}{} with
deionized water.
%We utilized xCells, the flows cells designed for the xSight, with each flow
%analyzing \SI{3}{\micro\liter} of sample passing through a \SI{50}{\um} deep observation volume;
%this provides us with scattering information of a few thousand colloidal spheres per sample.

We analyze \SI{3}{\micro\liter} of each sample by pipetting the diluted dispersion into an
xCell sample cell and loading the xCell into the xSight. The xSight draws the fluid through
the xCell's \SI{50}{\um} deep observation volume. A ten-minute measurement provides us with
characterization data for a few thousand colloidal spheres per sample.

      dot represents a single micrometer scatterer. Color denotes the density of
      observations. The fit to a parabolic flow profile is illustrated with a dashed
      blue line. (c) Scatter plot of data after filtering observations deviating
      from the parabolic profile.}
    \label{fig:flow_prof}
\end{figure}

\footnotetext{The focal plane is only \SI{90}{\um} below the lower sample-xCell interface:
  a to-scale diagram would depict the focal plane inside the lower xCell wall.}
The dilute suspension is pumped between the stationary walls of the xCell.
The resulting fluid flow takes on a parabolic profile known as a Poiseuille flow.
As the system is in a low-Reynolds number flow, every colloidal sphere traces
the flow of the fluid.
As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:flow_prof}(a), the xCell's walls are located
at \SI{90}{\um} and \SI{150}{\um} relative to the xSight's focal plane for this
particular sample.
Because the xSight records the mean $z$-position and mean 
velocity of all multiply-imaged scatterers, we are able to fit the flow
profile to a Poiseuille flow as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:flow_prof}(b).
The majority of observations fall neatly onto the parabolic profile. 
Some fits however deviate markedly. Presumably these data result from fitting
false positive detections of overlapping holograms.
We suppress these erroneous features by filtering data that deviate from
the parabolic profile by more than one median absolute deviation
as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:flow_prof}(c).

\subsection{Orthogonal validation methods}

We used scanning electron microscopy to provide baseline estimates of the
particles to compare against holographic characterization measurements.
Each sample of polymerized spheres were imaged with a MERLIN (Carl Zeiss) field
emission scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Typical images are provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:sem_stir_rate}(a).
SEM images provide a visual check on the sample's uniformity
and can be used to estimate the colloidal spheres' diameter. While a well calibrated scanning
electron microscope provides \num{1} to \SI{10}{\nm} resolution of features, sample
preparation, particularly vacuum decompression and sputter coating, can shrink or
even swell the sample \cite{yamada85,jung02}. The liquid TPM droplets
are not amendable to SEM analysis.

A common method for determining the refractive index of colloidal particles
requires index matching the particles to a solution with a known refractive index.
This procedure requires dispersing the particles in a solution and therefore
assumes that the solution does not chemically interact with the particles
and does not cause appreciable swelling.  Ref.~\cite{vanderwel17} estimated the
refractive index of polymerized TPM to be between $\num{1.512}$ and $\num{1.513}$ by index matching
to a solution of pyridine ($n = \SI{1.509}{}$) and \num{2}- ethylhexyl \num{4}-methoxycinnamate
($n = \SI{1.545}{}$). We instead estimate the refractive index from 
refractive index measurements of several dense suspensions of TPM spheres dispersed in water.
For most colloidal suspensions \cite{alexander81}, the refractive index
depends linearly on the volume fraction of particles. With measurements of the solution refractive
index at multiple volume fractions, we can accurately estimate the refractive index of
TPM particles. 

\section{Investigating the influence of synthesis conditions}
\subsection{Effect of stir rate}

Stirring the sample while the oligomers condense into droplets suppresses coalescence and
promotes homogeneous nucleation by uniformly dispersing the hydrolyzed monomer and droplet
nuclei. %%FIXME CHECK THIS STATEMENT.
The effect of stir rate on the resulting particle size is, however, less clear;
we investigated the influence of stir rate by producing \num{4} sets of TPM emulsions.
In four identical vials with identical stir bars, we placed \SI{15}{\milli\liter} of 
\SI{29}{\percent} ammonia followed by \SI{200}{\micro\liter} of TPM 
monomer to \SI{5}{\milli\liter} of DI water. The four samples were then stirred 
using magnetic stir plates set at \num{500}, \num{700}, \num{900}, and
\SI{1100}{\minute^{-1}} for \SI{2}{\hour}. 
The droplets were then polymerized by adding
\num{2},\num{2}'-azobis(\num{2}-methylpropionitrile, Sigma Aldrich) (AIBN)
as a radical initiator and %FIXME: Lot number of AIBN?
heating the sample to \SI{80}{\celsius} for \SI{2}{\hour}.
We prepared a sample of unpolymerized droplets and a sample of polymerized TPM spheres
at each of the four spin rates, for a total of eight samples.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{sem_stir_analysis}
    \caption{(a) Cropped and scaled SEM images of the polymerized TPM spheres whose
      samples were stirred at \num{500}, \num{700}, \num{900}, and \SI{1100}{\minute^{-1}}.
      (b)  Box and whisker plots summarize the diameters of colloidal spheres estimated from
      SEM digital images. Each rectangular box extends from the first quartile, $Q_1$, to
      the third quartile, $Q_3$, of the data; within each box a black line represents the median;
      the upper whisker extends to largest observed diameter less than $Q_3 + 1.5\, (Q_3 - Q_1)$;
      the lower whisker extends to the smallest observed diameter greater than $Q_1 - 1.5\, (Q_3 - Q_1)$;
      data beyond the whiskers are plotted as open circles. }
    \label{fig:sem_stir_rate}
\end{figure}

Each of the four samples of polymerized spheres were imaged with an SEM;
Fig.~\ref{fig:sem_stir_rate}(a) illustrates cropped and scaled regions of interest
for each sample. Estimates for the diameters for each sample
were produced by drawing tight-fitting ovals around each polymer sphere in the image;
the average of the each oval's minor and major axes provides an estimate for the
associated sphere's diameter. This hand-drawing procedure produced estimates
for \num{50} spheres for each sample, providing a total of \num{200} estimates
and are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:sem_stir_rate}(b). The average 
diameter, $\bar{d_{\text{p}}}$ and the standard deviation, $\sigma_{d_{\text{p}}}$
from this analysis for each of the four stir rates are reported
in table \ref{table:sem_data}. We note here that the polydispersity of the 
samples increase with the stir rate.

    \label{fig:abbe}
\end{figure}

Two similarly prepared samples of TPM spheres were used to estimate the refractive
index, $n_p$, of the colloidal spheres.
Each sample was diluted to \num{5} different volume fractions to provide a total of
\num{12} different suspensions, including the two stock samples. The refractive index of each
suspension was measured with an Abbe refractometer;
the results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:abbe}.
By assuming a linear relationship between volume fraction and suspension refractive
index, we estimate the refractive index of TPM colloidal spheres to be $n_{\text{p}} = \SI{1.506}{}$ with \SI{95}{\percent} confidence that it lies in the range $1.499 \le n_{\text{p}} \le 1.513$.

%In general, there exists a linear relationship between the volume fraction of colloidal
%spheres, $\phi$, and the suspension refractive index. We estimate the refractive
%index of polymerized TPM spheres by extrapolating from our low volume fraction data
%up to a volume fraction of \num{1}. Our estimate is bounded by a $\SI{95}{\percent}$
%prediction interval given by
%\begin{align}
%  \text{Prediction Interval} &= \hat{n_{\text{p}}} \pm t_{\alpha/2, N-2} \, \sqrt{ S^2 +  S_{\hat{n_{\text{p}}}}^2} \\
%  S_{\hat{n_{\text{p}}}}^2 &= S^2 \, \left ( \frac{1}{N} + \frac{\left ( \phi^* - \bar{\phi_i} \right )}{Y} \right )\\ 
%  S^2 &= \frac{\sum_i \left (n_i - (m \, \phi + b )\right )^2}{N-1}\\
%  S_{\phi\phi} &= \sum_i \phi_i^2 - \left ( \sum_i \phi_i \right )^2 /N

both processes might reasonably account for the observed increase.
Both values greatly exceed the refractive index of bulk TPM oil, which is indicated by
a dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig:hpc_stir_rate}(a).
Hydrolysis and oligomerization of the TPM comprising the droplet account for three quarters of
the total change; polymerization of the droplet accounts for the remaining quarter.

\subsection{Effect of heat bath exposure time}

We use heat-activated free-radical initiators to polymerize TPM droplets:
time spent thermally coupled to a heat bath greatly accelerates polymerization. 
As observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:hpc_stir_rate}(a), the polymerization of
liquid TPM droplets can induce a shift of approximately \SI{0.02}{} in refractive index
which is well within the precision of the xSight.  Because the refractive index
of a material is a function of its composition \cite{wang15},
refractive index serves as a proxy for the degree of polymerization.
Holographic particle characterization is uniquely poised to probe the time dependent
polymerization of TPM as it can monitor the refractive index of individual spheres
\emph{in situ}.

We investigate the polymerization rate of TPM droplets by regularly sampling a
suspension undergoing polymerization and characterizing each drawn sample with HPC.
Specifically, the suspension consists of an emulsion of TPM droplets
and the initiator AIBN. The suspension is continuously stirred at \SI{1100}{\min^{-1}}
and is thermally coupled to a heat bath set at \SI{80}{\degreeCelsius}.
We drew \SI{1}{\ul} of the suspension after \num{0}, \num{5}, \num{10}, \num{15},
\num{20}, \num{40}, and \SI{60}{\min} as the sample undergoes polymerization.
Each sample was added to \SI{1}{\ml} of room temperature DI water, which effectively
arrests any continued polymerization.
Each sample was then immediately characterized by the xSight. Figure ~\ref{fig:heat_size_time}
depicts the result of this chacterization.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{synthesis_heat_bath}
    \caption{Particle properties after heat bath exposure times of \num{0}, \num{5},
      \num{10}, \num{15}, \num{20}, \num{40}, and \SI{60}{\min}.

      of heat bath exposure time. Error bars indicate a single median absolute deviation
      of the associated property.}
    \label{fig:heat_size_time}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:heat_size_time} depicts the result of HPC for each
of the samples. The size of the TPM droplets are on average shrinking
during polymerization as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:heat_size_time}(a),
although the decrease in size is less than the polydispersity of each sample.
The decrease in size is approximately \SI{2}{\percent} which is consistent
with the \SI{7}{\percent} reduction in volume discussed in Ref.~\cite{vanderwel17}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:heat_size_time}(b) demonstrates a large shift in refractive index
from \SI{1.485}{} for unpolymerized droplets to a \SI{1.495}{} for the droplets
exposed to the heat bath for two hours.
At \num{15} and \SI{20}{\min} the refractive index significantly increases.
van der Wel \emph{et. al} \cite{vanderwel17} suggest heating the suspension
for \SI{2}{\hour} to ensure the sample has sufficiently polymerized and is
stable. Our analysis suggests that a much shorter time may suffice although
we have not confirmed the resulting stability of the polymerized sample.

\subsection{Effect of stoichiometry and choice of free-radical initiator}

Increasing the amount of TPM oil available in solution could increase the
average particle diameter, the number of resulting colloidal particles, or both.
In addition, increasing the pH of the solution will increase the rate of
oligomerization and could affect the average particle diameter and polydispersity.
To probe these two variables of droplet formation, we make four batches of droplets
and label them A, B, C, and D for ease.
In each batch we add the same \SI{5}{\milli \liter} volume of deionized water
and vary the amounts of TPM oil and ammonia. Batches A and B each had 
\SI{100}{\micro\liter} of TPM with \si{10} and \SI{20}{\micro\liter} of 
ammonia added, respectively. Batches C and D had \SI{150}{\micro\liter} of TPM oil, 
again with \si{10} and \SI{20}{\micro\liter} of ammonia, respectively. 

% FIXME: We do not have results (?) for the unpolymerized droplets from
% batches A, B, C, or D in May 2018. We do have some results from Jan 2018
% but that is from a different synthesis. :-/
%\SI{0.1}{\percent} sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS) was introduced to
%each sample to suppress aggregation. Through this, we can observe the effects of
%varying the amount of TPM and the pH on the size of the resulting droplets.

% XXX (Add conclusions about initiator- does not seem to matter)

With the four batches described above, we additionally observe the effect of using
different free radical initiators to polymerize the particles.
Two water-insoluble initiators, AIBN and
\num{1},\num{1}'-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) (ACHN), and two water-soluble 
initiators, potassium persulfate (KPS) and ammonium persulfate APS), were 
used. To compare initiators, one \SI{5}{\milli \liter} suspension of from emulsion droplets
in batches A, B, C, and D were 
made in a \SI{12}{\milli \liter} vial and then equally divided into four % five in reality.. but see below
\SI{1.5}{\milli \liter} microcentrifuge tubes.
% One tube was left unpolymerized.
The four tubes were then polymerized at \SI{80}{\celsius} 
for \SI{12}{\hour} on a shaker at \SI{750}{\minute^{-1}} % XXX Again, rpm vs mins^{-1}
to prevent sedimentation.
We added a different free radical initiator to each tube and repeated the process with four
different emulsions for a total of 
\num{16} measurements to ensure that any observations were the result of the 
initiator used and not of the particular protocol used to make the emulsion.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{may_data_summary.png}
    \caption{The refractive index and diameter of 16 samples of 
    polymerized TPM.}
    \label{fig:initiator_data}
\end{figure}

In making the \si{16} sets of particles to look at the effect of initiator on 
the particles, we can also make observations about the effects of varying 
the amount of TPM and the pH on the size of the resulting droplets. To hold 
the pH constant, we can compare sample A to C and sample B to D. This gives 
the fairly intuitive result that increasing the amount of TPM increases the 
size of the final droplet. Holding the amount of TPM constant and varying 
the pH, which means comparing A to B and C to D, shows that increasing the 
pH of the environment during droplet formation decreases the size of the 
final droplet. This is less intuitive but perhaps not surprising, as the pH 
affects the rate at which oligomers form and therefore the rate of droplet 
formation. This leads to more nucleation sites and therefore smaller droplets 
for the same volume of material. 

Comparing batches A to C, each with \SI{100}{\micro \liter} of TPM monomer, and B to D with
\SI{150}{\micro \liter}, gives the somewhat intuitive result that increasing the amount of TPM
monomer increases the size of the final droplet. On the other hand, comparing A to B with
\SI{10}{\micro \liter} ammonia and C to D with \SI{15}{\micro \liter} ammonia shows that
increasing the pH of the environment during droplet formation decreases the size of the 
final droplet. This is less intuitive but perhaps not surprising, as the pH 
affects the rate at which oligomers form and, therefore, the rate of droplet 
formation. Increasing the pH results in more nucleation sites and therefore smaller droplets 
for the same volume of material. 

Under certain conditions, TPM droplets are known to form dimpled spheres when polymerized
with the water-soluble initiators APS and KPS due to the ejection of low molecular weight
oligomers \cite{sacanna11}. %FIXME Check reference.
Therefore, one might think that TPM spheres polymerized with these initiators would be
made of on average higher molecular weight oligomers and have a higher refractive index
than pa. However, under the conditions observed here where no dimple was formed, there
was no observable difference in particle size or refractive index between the initiators
used.
