\chapter{Optimizing the synthesis of monodisperse colloidal spheres}
\label{ch:synthesis}

\section{Introduction}

The earliest reference to emulsion polymerization dates back to
1909 \cite{bayer1909,finch03} to a patent awarded to Felix Hoffmann and
co-workers at Farbenfabriken Bayer for their pioneering work in manufacturing
synthetic latex.
Techniques for polymerizing emulsions have progressed  over the ensuing century
through intuitive leaps guided by fundamental principles of chemistry
and physics.  Controlling the size, monodispersity, and composition of
colloidal spheres is crucial for many applications including micrometer-scale
self-assembly \cite{pusey87,sacanna11}. Most often, the influences of particular chemical
or physical conditions to the outcome only can be gauged once
synthesis is complete; these assays typically require multiple orthogonal measurement
techniques.
Scanning electron microscopy, for example, is used to measure solid particles'
size distributions and surface texture. Mercury porosimetry gauges their
porosity. Various optical techniques probe their optical properties.
Assessing characterization results takes considerable time and requires
expertise in multiple techniques. Preparing samples for measurement,
furthermore, can change their properties. Correlations among particle
properties are especially difficult to measure.

Holographic particle characterization can streamline this analysis by providing
particle-resolved assays of samples' size distributions and compositions rapidly and with
minimal sample preparation. Holographic characterization works equally
well for droplets and solid particles. It naturally accommodates very heterogeneous
samples and reveals correlations between size and composition. Extensions to the technique
provide particle-resolved morphology measurements from the same data. All of this information
can be acquired in under a half an hour, which expedites systematic assays and can be
fast enough to provide feedback for process control.

%Holographic assays provide information that is useful for designing synthetic
%pathways and can help to detect and diagnose deficiencies. These measurements
%can proceed rapidly enough, moreover, to provide real-time feedback during
%synthesis. We illustrate these capacities by analyzing the synthesis of a
%particularly interest colloidal suspension.

In this chapter, we use holographic particle characterization
to explore the role of stoichiometry, initiator choice, and
agitation conditions in the synthesis of monodisperse spheres of
3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TPM) \cite{vanderwel17},
a model system with increasingly widespread applications
in soft-matter research \cite{sacanna11,liu16,vanderwel18}.
We employ holographic characterization
in tandem with conventional particle characterization
techniques to identify factors that influence size selection, polydispersity,
and surface texture.
These orthogonal measurements also serve to validate the results observed
holographically.
This study extends the work of van der Wel \emph{et.} \emph{al} \cite{vanderwel17}, which
uses conventional characterization techniques to systematically
characterize the emulsion polymerization protocol for TPM spheres.

\section{Synthesizing TPM spheres}

Since their introduction in 2010 \cite{sacanna10}, TPM spheres have been used to
study self-assembly \cite{sacanna13} and active matter \cite{palacci13}.
They are particularly attractive for optical studies because they can be
simultaneously density matched and index matched to their surrounding
media \cite{liu16}.
A comparatively straightforward synthesis readily produces monodisperse spheres
with sizes selected reproducibly in the range of a few hundred nanometers to a
few micrometers \cite{liu16}.
Unlike the better-known syntheses of polystyrene \cite{goodwin1974} and
silica \cite{stober68},
emulsion polymerization of TPM requires no specialized equipment or
inert environment.

\subsection{Emulsion polymerization}
\label{ssec:polymerization}

Our procedure for synthesizing TPM spheres is described in section
\ref{ssec:synthesizing_tpm} with the
exception of initiator choice. We reiterate the synthesis protocol
here to underscore the conditions we varied and to enumerate the
\num{32} samples of droplets and polymerized spheres we analyzed.
A detailed account of the polymer chemistry underlying this
protocol is provided in Ref.~\cite{vanderwel17}.

The protocols chosen for this study illuminate the influence of stir rate, pH,
emulsion stoichiometry, and radical initiator choice on the size and refractive index
of the synthesized particles. While this list is not exhaustive,
it illustrates choices made in optimizing synthesis protocols and the role
that holographic characterization can play in making successful choices.

The synthesis begins with the formation of an emulsion of monodisperse TPM droplets.
Monomeric TPM, ((3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate, \SI{98}{\percent}, Sigma Aldrich)
is insoluble in water. When it is added to the basic environment
of ammonium chloride (\SI{29}{\percent}) in water (pH $>$ \num{9}),
the monomers undergo hydrolysis and become soluble. 
These hydrolyzed monomers then form insoluble 
oligomers that condense homogeneously into monodisperse droplets.
These nuclei continue to grow in a well-mixed environment as more oligomers form.
Once the free hydrolyzed monomer is depleted, oligomerization stops and
the droplets stop growing.
The emulsion is then heated to \SI{80}{\degreeCelsius} and a heat activated free radical 
initiator is introduced to polymerize the droplets into solid spheres.

Dissociation of ammonium chloride in water leads to the production of ammonia
gas, which escapes the solution and reduces its pH.
To mitigate this effect, the emulsion is prepared in a closed vial.
We use identical \SI{12}{\milli\liter} vials to produce \SI{5}{\milli\liter}
of colloidal suspension so that the volume of enclosed air, and therefore
the loss in pH, is reproducible from batch to batch. Identical stir bars are used for all syntheses
to ensure consistent flow properties.

\subsection{Holographic particle characterization}

We perform holographic characterization measurements with a Spheryx xSight,
a commercial holographic particle characterization system
that automates the methods described in the previous chapters.
The xSight draws a small sample of colloidal suspension through the
observation volume of a conventional microscope where it is illuminated
with a laser operating at a vacuum wavelength of \SI{532}{\nm}.
The instrument's analytical software processes particles' holograms automatically
and yields the size and refractive index for each observed colloidal sphere
in a fraction of the time we typically spend analyzing an experimental video.
Because we are interested in collecting population statistics for the size and refractive
index of our TPM samples, we utilize the xSight rather than our custom-built holographic
microscope.

The xSight analyzes colloidal dispersions with particle number densities below 
\SI{E6}{\milli\liter^{-1}} to minimize the occurrence of overlapping holograms.
This limitation is discussed in section \ref{ssec:sample_prep}.
The emulsion polymerization process described in the previous section
produces a sample with a number density of \SI{E10}{\milli\liter^{-1}}.
We therefore dilute each of our samples by a factor of \SI{E4}{} with
deionized water before analysis.

We analyze each sample by pipetting \SI{100}{\micro\liter} of the diluted dispersion into an
xCell sample cell and loading the xCell into the xSight. The xSight draws \SI{3}{\micro\liter}
of the fluid through
the xCell's \SI{50}{\um} deep observation volume. A ten-minute measurement provides us with
characterization data for a few thousand colloidal spheres per sample.

      dot represents a single micrometer scatterer. Color denotes the density of
      observations. The fit to a parabolic flow profile is illustrated with a dashed
      blue line. (c) Scatter plot of data after filtering observations deviating
      from the parabolic profile.}
    \label{fig:flow_prof}
\end{figure}

\footnotetext{The focal plane is \SI{90}{\um} below the lower sample-xCell interface:
  a scale diagram would depict the focal plane inside the lower xCell wall.}

The sample flows between the stationary walls of the xCell with a parabolic, Poiseuille
profile.
The particles act as passive tracers of this flow.
The xSight uses holographic tracking data to map the local fluid velocity within
the channel \cite{cheong10a}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:flow_prof}.
Each point in Fig.~\ref{fig:flow_prof}(a) represents the measurement speed
and axial position, $v(z)$, for a single particle.
As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:flow_prof}(a),
the particle's axial position is measured relative to the microscope's
focal plane. The solid curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:flow_prof}(b) is a fit to the
anticipated parabolic flow profile. Extrapolating to $v(z)=0$ yields the
axial position of this channel's walls, assuming
no-slip boundary conditions. 
The majority of observations fall neatly onto the parabolic profile.
% Note that velocities should deviate by a small amount due to Brownian motion.
Some fits, however, deviate markedly. Presumably these data result from fitting
false positive detections of overlapping holograms.
We suppress these erroneous features by filtering data that deviate from
the parabolic profile by more than one median absolute deviation
as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:flow_prof}(c). The remaining results are used
to characterize the sample.
% Why this degree of cutting?

\subsection{Orthogonal validation methods}

Holographic particle characterization is a comparatively new technique,
and is not yet widely adopted. We therefore validate results from
holographic particle characterization with measurements from orthogonal
techniques.
We use scanning electron microscopy to provide baseline estimates for the
particles' diameters.
Each sample of polymerized spheres were imaged with a MERLIN (Carl Zeiss) field
emission scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Typical images are provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:sem_stir_rate}(a).
SEM images provide a visual check on the sample's uniformity
and can be used to estimate the colloidal spheres' diameter. While a well calibrated scanning
electron microscope provides \num{1} to \SI{10}{\nm} spatial resolution, sample
preparation, particularly exposure to vacuum and sputter coating, can shrink or
even swell the sample \cite{yamada85,jung02}. The liquid TPM droplets
are not amendable to SEM analysis.

A common method for determining the refractive index of colloidal particles
involves index matching the particles to a solution with a known refractive index.
This procedure requires dispersing the particles in an index-matching solution
rather than their native medium and therefore necessitates
that the solution not affect the particle's properties, for
example by swelling.  Reference~\cite{vanderwel17} estimated the
refractive index of polymerized TPM colloids to be between $\num{1.512}$ and $\num{1.513}$
by index matching to a solution of pyridine ($n = \SI{1.509}{}$) and \num{2}-ethylhexyl
\num{4}-methoxycinnamate ($n = \SI{1.545}{}$). We instead estimate the spheres'
refractive index by measuring the refractive index of the suspension as a function of
volume fraction in water. Extrapolating  to \SI{100}{\percent} volume fraction
yields the spheres' refractive index \cite{alexander81} in their native medium.

\section{Influence of synthesis conditions}
\subsection{Effect of stir rate}

Stirring the sample while the oligomers condense into droplets promotes homogeneous
nucleation by uniformly dispersing the hydrolyzed monomer and droplet nuclei.
Beyond simply mixing the sample, however, stirring engenders shear forces that can
also alter droplets size distribution.
Therefore the effect of stir rate on the resulting particle size should be assessed
experimentally.
We investigate the influence of stir rate by producing \num{4} sets of TPM emulsions
in four identical vials with identical stir bars. Each vial was filled with
\SI{15}{\micro\liter} of \SI{29}{\percent} ammonia followed by
\SI{200}{\micro\liter} of TPM monomer to \SI{5}{\milli\liter} of DI water.
The four samples were stirred 
using magnetic stir plates set at \num{500}, \num{700}, \num{900}, and
\SI{1100}{\minute^{-1}} for \SI{2}{\hour}. 
The resulting droplets were polymerized by adding
\num{2},\num{2}'-azobis(\num{2}-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN, Sigma Aldrich)
as a radical initiator and %FIXME: Lot number of AIBN?
heating the sample to \SI{80}{\celsius} for \SI{2}{\hour}.
We prepared samples of unpolymerized droplets and samples of polymerized TPM spheres
at each of the four spin rates for a total of eight samples.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{sem_stir_analysis}
    \caption{(a) Cropped and scaled SEM images of the polymerized TPM spheres whose
      samples were stirred at \num{500}, \num{700}, \num{900}, and \SI{1100}{\minute^{-1}}.
      (b)  Box and whisker plots summarize the diameters of colloidal spheres estimated from
      SEM digital images. Each rectangular box extends from the first quartile, $Q_1$, to
      the third quartile, $Q_3$, of the data; within each box a black line represents the median;
      the upper whisker extends to largest observed diameter less than $Q_3 + 1.5\, (Q_3 - Q_1)$;
      the lower whisker extends to the smallest observed diameter greater than $Q_1 - 1.5\, (Q_3 - Q_1)$;
      data beyond the whiskers are plotted as open circles. }
    \label{fig:sem_stir_rate}
\end{figure}

Each of the four samples of polymerized spheres was imaged with an SEM.
Figure~\ref{fig:sem_stir_rate}(a) shows cropped and scaled regions of interest
for each sample. The mean sphere diameter in a sample was estimated by analyzing
spheres' images using ImageJ. The diameter of an individual sphere was obtained by
drawing a tight-fitting oval around its image;
the average of each oval's minor and major axes provides an estimate for the
associated sphere's diameter. Results of this manual survey are summarized in
Fig.~\ref{fig:sem_stir_rate}(b). The average 
diameters, $\avg{d_{\text{p}}}$, and their standard deviations, $\sigma_{d_{\text{p}}}$,
for each of the four stir rates are reported
in table \ref{table:sem_data}.
Any trend in the mean diameter is obscured by the increase in polydispersity
with increasing stir rate. SEM analysis suggests that this may be
due to an increase in the population of undersized spheres with increasing
shear rate.

\end{tabular}
\label{table:sem_data}
\end{table}

Two similarly prepared samples of TPM spheres were used to estimate the refractive
index, $n_p$, of the colloidal spheres.
Each sample was diluted to \num{5} different volume fractions to provide a total of
\num{12} different suspensions, including the two stock samples. The refractive index of each
suspension was measured with an Abbe refractometer;
the results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:abbe}.
By assuming a linear relationship between volume fraction and suspension refractive
index, we estimate the refractive index of TPM colloidal spheres to be $n_{\text{p}} = \SI{1.506}{}$ with \SI{95}{\percent} confidence that it lies in the range $1.499 \le n_{\text{p}} \le 1.513$.

      the refractive index of polymerized TPM, $n_{\text{p}}$, represented as a red dot.
      The light blue region encompassing the linear fit denotes a $\SI{95}{\percent}$
      prediction interval that bounds the error in our extrapolated estimate of refractive
      index.

%In general, there exists a linear relationship between the volume fraction of colloidal
%spheres, $\phi$, and the suspension refractive index. We estimate the refractive
%index of polymerized TPM spheres by extrapolating from our low volume fraction data
%up to a volume fraction of \num{1}. Our estimate is bounded by a $\SI{95}{\percent}$
%prediction interval given by
%\begin{align}
%  \text{Prediction Interval} &= \hat{n_{\text{p}}} \pm t_{\alpha/2, N-2} \, \sqrt{ S^2 +  S_{\hat{n_{\text{p}}}}^2} \\

both processes might reasonably account for the observed increase.
Both values greatly exceed the refractive index of bulk TPM oil, which is indicated by
a dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig:hpc_stir_rate}(a).
Hydrolysis and oligomerization of the TPM comprising the droplet account for three quarters of
the total change; polymerization of the droplet accounts for the remaining quarter.

\subsection{Effect of heat bath exposure time}

We use heat-activated free-radical initiators to polymerize TPM droplets:
time spent thermally coupled to a heat bath greatly accelerates polymerization. 
As observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:hpc_stir_rate}(a), the polymerization of
liquid TPM droplets can induce a shift of approximately \SI{0.02}{} in refractive index
which is well within the precision of the xSight.  Because the refractive index
of a material is a function of its composition \cite{wang15},
refractive index serves as a proxy for the degree of polymerization.
Holographic particle characterization is uniquely poised to probe the time dependent
polymerization of TPM as it can monitor the refractive index of individual spheres
\emph{in situ}.

We investigate the polymerization rate of TPM droplets by regularly sampling a
suspension undergoing polymerization and characterizing each drawn sample with HPC.
Specifically, the suspension consists of an emulsion of TPM droplets
and the initiator AIBN. The suspension is continuously stirred at \SI{1100}{\min^{-1}}
and is thermally coupled to a heat bath set at \SI{80}{\degreeCelsius}.
We drew \SI{1}{\ul} of the suspension after \num{0}, \num{5}, \num{10}, \num{15},
\num{20}, \num{40}, and \SI{60}{\min} as the sample undergoes polymerization.
Each sample was added to \SI{10}{\ml} of room temperature DI water, which effectively
arrests any continued polymerization. 
Each sample was then immediately characterized by the xSight. Figure ~\ref{fig:heat_size_time}
depicts the result of this chacterization.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{synthesis_heat_bath}
    \caption{Particle properties after heat bath exposure times of \num{0}, \num{5},
      \num{10}, \num{15}, \num{20}, \num{40}, and \SI{60}{\min}.

      of heat bath exposure time. Error bars indicate a single median absolute deviation
      of the associated property.}
    \label{fig:heat_size_time}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:heat_size_time} depicts the result of HPC for each
of the samples. The size of the TPM droplets are on average shrinking
during polymerization as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:heat_size_time}(a),
although the decrease in size is less than the polydispersity of each sample.
The decrease in size is approximately \SI{2}{\percent} which is consistent
with the \SI{7}{\percent} reduction in volume discussed in Ref.~\cite{vanderwel17}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:heat_size_time}(b) demonstrates a large shift in refractive index
from \SI{1.485}{} for unpolymerized droplets to a \SI{1.495}{} for the droplets
exposed to the heat bath for two hours.
At \num{15} and \SI{20}{\min} the refractive index significantly increases.
Van der Wel \emph{et. al} \cite{vanderwel17} suggest heating the suspension
for \SI{2}{\hour} to ensure the sample has sufficiently polymerized and is
stable. Our analysis suggests that a much shorter time may suffice although
we have not confirmed the resulting stability of the polymerized sample.

\subsection{Effect of stoichiometry and choice of free-radical initiator}

Increasing the amount of TPM oil available in solution could increase the
average particle diameter, the number of resulting colloidal particles, or both.
In addition, increasing the pH of the solution will increase the rate of
oligomerization and could affect the average particle diameter and polydispersity.
To probe these two variables of droplet formation, we make four batches of droplets
and label them A, B, C, and D for ease.
In each batch we add the same \SI{5}{\milli \liter} volume of deionized water
and vary the amounts of TPM oil and ammonia. Batches A and B each had 
\SI{100}{\micro\liter} of TPM with \si{10} and \SI{20}{\micro\liter} of 
ammonia added, respectively. Batches C and D had \SI{150}{\micro\liter} of TPM oil, 
again with \si{10} and \SI{20}{\micro\liter} of ammonia, respectively. 

% FIXME: We do not have results (?) for the unpolymerized droplets from
% batches A, B, C, or D in May 2018. We do have some results from Jan 2018
% but that is from a different synthesis. :-/
%\SI{0.1}{\percent} sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS) was introduced to
%each sample to suppress aggregation. Through this, we can observe the effects of
%varying the amount of TPM and the pH on the size of the resulting droplets.

% XXX (Add conclusions about initiator- does not seem to matter)

With the four batches described above, we additionally observe the effect of using
different free radical initiators to polymerize the particles.
Two water-insoluble initiators, AIBN and
\num{1},\num{1}'-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) (ACHN), and two water-soluble 
initiators, potassium persulfate (KPS) and ammonium persulfate APS), were 
used. To compare initiators, one \SI{5}{\milli \liter} suspension of from emulsion droplets
in batches A, B, C, and D were 
made in a \SI{12}{\milli \liter} vial and then equally divided into four % five in reality.. but see below
\SI{1.5}{\milli \liter} microcentrifuge tubes.
% One tube was left unpolymerized.
The four tubes were then polymerized at \SI{80}{\celsius} 
for \SI{12}{\hour} on a shaker at \SI{750}{\minute^{-1}} % XXX Again, rpm vs mins^{-1}
to prevent sedimentation.
We added a different free radical initiator to each tube and repeated the process with four
different emulsions for a total of 
\num{16} measurements to ensure that any observations were the result of the 
initiator used and not of the particular protocol used to make the emulsion.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{longitudinal_summary.png}
    \caption{Holographic characterization results for various initiators and
      emulsion compositions. (a) The refractive index and diameter of all \num{16} samples of 
      polymerized TPM. (b) Mean diameter as a function of TPM added at fixed ammonium chloride.
    (c) Mean diameter as a function of ammonium chloride added at fixed TPM.}
    \label{fig:longitudinal_summary}
\end{figure}

In making the \si{16} sets of particles to look at the effect of initiator on 
the particles, we can also make observations about the effects of varying 
the amount of TPM and the pH on the size of the resulting droplets. To hold 
the pH constant, we can compare sample A to C and sample B to D. This gives 
the fairly intuitive result that increasing the amount of TPM increases the 
size of the final droplet. Holding the amount of TPM constant and varying 
the pH, which means comparing A to B and C to D, shows that increasing the 
pH of the environment during droplet formation decreases the size of the 
final droplet. This is less intuitive but perhaps not surprising, as the pH 
affects the rate at which oligomers form and therefore the rate of droplet 
formation. This leads to more nucleation sites and therefore smaller droplets 
for the same volume of material. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{longitudinal_np.png}
    \caption{Mean refractive index reported for each radical initiator
    at fixed TPM}
    \label{fig:longitudinal_np}
\end{figure}


Comparing batches A to C, each with \SI{100}{\micro \liter} of TPM monomer, and B to D with
\SI{150}{\micro \liter}, gives the somewhat intuitive result that increasing the amount of TPM
monomer increases the size of the final droplet. On the other hand, comparing A to B with
\SI{10}{\micro \liter} ammonia and C to D with \SI{15}{\micro \liter} ammonia shows that
increasing the pH of the environment during droplet formation decreases the size of the 
final droplet. This is less intuitive but perhaps not surprising, as the pH 
affects the rate at which oligomers form and, therefore, the rate of droplet 
formation. Increasing the pH results in more nucleation sites and therefore smaller droplets 
for the same volume of material. 

Under certain conditions, TPM droplets are known to form dimpled spheres when polymerized
with the water-soluble initiators APS and KPS due to the ejection of low molecular weight
oligomers \cite{sacanna11}. %FIXME Check reference.
Therefore, one might think that TPM spheres polymerized with these initiators would be
made of on average higher molecular weight oligomers and have a higher refractive index
than pa. However, under the conditions observed here where no dimple was formed, there
was no observable difference in particle size or refractive index between the initiators
used.
