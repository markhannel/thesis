\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{ch:conclusion}

This thesis validates, extends, and employs holographic
particle characterization. Prior to these collection
of works,

\autoref{ch:debye} validates the use of the scalar theory
approximation for holographic
particle characterization with the Lorenz-Mie theory.
By fitting synthetic holograms based on a vector-based
theory to a scalar theory,
Our simulations determine that for scatterers between the
sizes of \% insert range, the scalar theory is offers
the same prediction as a vector-based theory, albeit
with a less computational overhead.
