Colloidal systems that are out of chemical and mechanical equilibrium 
usually exhibit interesting transitions in their properties. Holographic 
video microscopy can measure the properties of individual colloidal 
particles precisely enough to track subtle transformations and rapidly 
enough to monitor real-time process. This ability offers valuable and 
previously unavailable insights into the mechanisms of mutable colloidal 
systems undergoing chemical and physical reactions. This thesis 
illustrates and demonstrates those capabilities through experiments on 
mutable colloidal systems, and presents models for such transition 
processes by applying statistical physics principles and effective 
medium theory.

In the first case, we investigate the chemical synthesis process of 
monodisperse samples of crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) spheres. 
The measured time dependence of these spheres' most probable radius can 
be modeled by a modified LaMer model for colloidal growth. The 
polydispersity's time evolution is consistent with the assumptions made 
in the growth model. The joint distribution of size and refractive index 
also reveals a small proportion of undersized, lower-density spheres. 
Trends in the distribution's time evolution offer insights into their 
origin and growth mechanism. Applied over longer time periods, 
holographic characterization also tracks how the newly-synthesized 
spheres age, and illuminates the aging mechanism.

We also discover in another system that colloidal spheres synthesized as 
polymer gels swell by absorbing soluble molecules from solution.
The resulting change in size can be monitored with nanometer
precision using holographic video microscopy.
When the absorbate is chemically similar to the polymer matrix,
swelling is driven primarily by the entropy of mixing, and
is limited by the elastic energy of the polymer matrix and the surface 
tension of the swelling sphere.
We demonstrate through a combination of holographic optical trapping and 
holographic video microscopy techniques that the degree of swelling of a 
single polymer bead can be used to measure the monomer concentration
\emph{in  situ}
with spatial resolution comparable to the size of the sphere.
The change in the probe's size and refractive index can be used to extract the absorbate refractive index based on an effective medium theory analysis.

Lastly, we demonstrate how holographic video microscopy can be used to 
detect, count and characterize individual micrometer-scale protein 
aggregates and polystyrene fractal aggregates as they flow down a 
microfluidic channel in their native solution. Holographic 
characterization provides results of radius and refractive index of the 
aggregates, and can be interpreted with an effective-sphere model to 
obtain the population-averaged fractal dimension. A simulation on the 
stratified gradient-index model are performed to check the validity of 
the fractal analysis. Holographic video 
microscopy also offers insights into the morphology of these aggregates.
