%The Lorenz-Mie Scattering theory has been applied in a host of contexts:
%dust particles in space, dynamic and static light scattering, color spectra
%through mists, etc.

%The structures and dynamics of soft matter systems are often micrometer in 
%scale. In addition, smaller features of interest can be examined with micrometer
%scale probes. Since visible wavelengths are on the order of a micrometer, such 
%systems are ripe to be investigated with visible wavelength microscopy 
%techniques.

%Conventional microscopy has been ubiquitously used to investigate soft matter systems. However, bright field illumination provides amplitude-only information as phase information has been averaged away. Some phase-based techniques are simply used to increase contrast in images. However, techniques like Holographic Video microscopy make full use of phase information contributing to image formation at the camera plane.
