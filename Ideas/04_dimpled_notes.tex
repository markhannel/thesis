Big Goals:
Explain TPM synthesis (Homogeneously nucleated and inhomogeneously nucleated)
Results for trapped particles and for particles flowing through a flow cell
Explain the heuristic in 4.4 a bit better? Maybe provide some evidence?
    
Small Points:

To Do:
    Remove the current introduction.
    Add references for dimpled spheres / lock and key particles
    Fix bibliography
    Simplify method section in 4.3
    Dress up the golfball plot?
    Rework the TPM synthesis section
