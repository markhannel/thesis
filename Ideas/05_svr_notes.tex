Big Goals:
Characterization requires good initial estimates.
We will demonstrate the use of SVM's as intiial estimates for size, refractive
index and height, or should the threshold for precision be low enough, a stand-alone
quick measurement.

Small Points:

Dimensionality reduction vs sensitivity to the center estimate and/or discretization
of the field via finite pixel size
- 200x200=40,000 vs 100
- Discretization of a hologram varying faster that 1/pix
- if center estimate is off...


To Do:
    See if there is a more recent version of this paper
    Read up on SVM's again
    Rework the introduction
    Emphasize the sensitivity to initial parameter estimation
    and the inability to fit disparate particles in the same
    sample.
    Discuss methods for estimating the height and size of a scatterer.
    Discuss dimensionality reduction by utilizing the radial profile
    - 200x200 = 40,000 vs 100
